#SpudHUD
A TF2 HUD that was inspired by OMPHUD and BwHUD

**Customising Your HUD** If you would like to make personal changes to the hud i'd recommend using NotePad++: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

Installation
============
### Download
To download this hud, click the "Download ZIP" button to the right. Alternatively, click this:
https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/archive/master.zip

### Installing
After extracting the hud, navigate to: `\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\custom\` and move the "budhud" folder into your custom folder (NOT the entirety of "budhud-master"). If you do not have a custom folder, create it.

Your directory should then look like this: `\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\custom\budhud` and contain `materials`, `resource`, and `scripts`. The `_Customization_` folder can be deleted or stored somewhere else if you intend to use files from it.
