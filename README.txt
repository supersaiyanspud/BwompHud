SpudHud
SpudHud is a tf2 custom interface (Hud) that was created by me, Spud. 

####Editing:
If you wish to edit this hud to your preferences, i recommend downloading Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ as opening the hud's files with regular notepad would looks extremely confusing.

####How to install:
If you don't already have one, be sure to create a 'custom' folder in your tf2 directory `\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\`. Then, download this hud by clicking the download zip button at the top right of the page. After the .zip file has downloaded, navigate to your custom folder and place the .zip file there. Once the .zip is in the custom folder, right click it and click 'extract here'. And thats all there is to it! The custom HUD is now installed :)
