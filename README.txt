Changing backgrounds
---------------------
If you would like to change the background between gif/non-gif then all you have to do is go into resource\ui\mainmenuoverride.res and find "BGgif". Once you have found that, set the values of "enabled" and "visible" to "1" or "0" and then type mat_antialias 1 in console to swap.
